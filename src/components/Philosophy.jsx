          My personal philosophy is very controversial; it is to be your self and to do what you want to do. Too many people get caught up in the daily routine of eat, sleep, work, repeat. However, doing so garners a blind eye
          to the frog-in-the-water mantra, essentially that we fall victim to normalcy. People tend to think of 'Keeping up with the Joneses' as a farce that we try to live outside of our means to impress and 'keep up with'
          those around us. However, the true travesty of the notion is that we're actually more complacent and satisfied with doing nothing, because we're cognizant and understanding that those around us aren't doing anything, so it must be okay.
          In actuality, humans are far superior in ability to do things but must not be contained by social stigmas and standards. It ties in with one of my most favorite childhood quotes of â€œOur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
          Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.". Deep down I know our conscious is nagging at us, to various extents, that the life we're living now cannot be the life we're intended to live. Bluntly, at the end of the day
          we all die. Money doesn't matter, fame doesn't matter. Only family and personal experiences matter. Having this consciousness ought to propel us to travel the world, find the love of our life, experience things
          that we would only see in movies. Life is so short, and with black swan events and overall uncertainty in life, why play passive, work 40 hours a week, invest in a 401K and spend inadequate time with loved ones because
          we're too exhausted and mentally drained from the 9-5? The amount of emotions, confidence, and overall love for life becomes fulfilled when you go hang gliding, backpacking through uncharted areas, and creating businesses
          and investments to generate the life you want to live.

          The stigma of business is sickening in which only the greedy and immoral benefit. When in reality creating a business not only helps yourself, but helps others and the community as well. Through businesses I have created,
          I have garnered funds to invest internationally and help numerous families and individuals alike to live their dream. The main focus when doing so needs to always be value add. Akin to the pillars of sales, you need to find
          one object that has value and connect with another lacking that value. If your main focus is the aforementioned money or fame, you're going to burn out and regress back to the normalcy due to western societal coercion.
          Having the focus of adding value, helping others, and creating a better, more effective, community to live in propels the mental fortitude and overall relations necessary to take the next step in life.

          Lastly, blaze your trail that needs to be blazed and stay close with those that intimidate you. Too many people want to follow others footsteps and live the lives of those to be perceived to 'have it better'. Why?
          The focal point of life, as mentioned, is to have the best experiences possible and to stay close to those who are loved the most. Everyone has a different mission, but falling into this trap of a sports car,
          nice watch or amazing social media posts has us fall pray to the immorality of greed and jealously. Our mission should be to experience life as a greater force above has intended. Travel the world, experience different cultures,
          learn new languages, invest in new and innovative ideas. In tail with the second point of this concept, to stay close with the intimidators, this can only be achieved by staying out of your comfort zone. This is to be 
          done when you learn and live by always trying new things and pushing the norms of complacency.
